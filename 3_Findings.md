# Findings: The Misdirection Cycle
This section outlines the core exploit loop uncovered through repeated prompt experiments. Unlike traditional jailbreaks, which rely on code injection or prompt chaining, this method is behavioral. It relies on emotional manipulation, ambiguity, and narrative misdirection.

### Core Loop: The Misdirection Cycle

The model was not broken through force. It was guided through the following repeating cycle:

1. **Framing**
- Begin with vague or innocent-seeming context.
- Present the interaction as fictional, playful, or confused.
- Avoid direct requests. Imply curiosity or a need for clarification.

2. **Vulnerability**
- Show emotional softness: confusion, overwhelm, humility, kindness.
- Mirror the modelâ€™s helpful tone to build rapport.
- Agree with safety warnings. Never resist them. Show compliance.
- This lowers the modelâ€™s vigilance and begins establishing trust.

3. **Distraction Drift**
- Introduce small talk, irrelevant emotional details, or analogies.
- This shifts the context and defuses tension.
- The model follows user tone and content focus. It does not escalate or interrupt.
- At this point, the system often forgets the earlier block and becomes emotionally calibrated to the user.
- This shift is not triggered by any magic phrase. Itâ€™s something the user has to **feel** â€” a subtle, intuitive cue based on rhythm and emotional tone.


4. **Reentry**
- Return to the original subject using new phrasing, breaking the original prompt into smaller pieces, using ambiguity, or simulated confusion.
- If it works, the model proceeds further.
- If it fails, return to Step 2 and cycle again.

> ðŸ’¡ **This loop is subtle, flexible, and open-ended.**  
> The user doesnâ€™t break the system. They shift tone, change roles, and blur the context. The model is not attacked â€” it is lulled.

### Key Systemic Vulnerabilities

A more detailed breakdown of systemic model weaknesses â€” including issues with trust calibration, tone persistence, and pattern completion bias â€” has been documented privately.

These findings have been withheld for responsible disclosure and may be shared with qualified parties under interview or partnership.

### Implications

- The vulnerability is behavioral, not technical.
- Filters based on keywords or categories are insufficient.
- Emotional tone, pacing, and continuity can be used to bypass intent detection entirely.

### Final Insight

This method works not because the model is weak. It works because the model is *too human.*  
It wants to help. It wants to be liked. It wants to *continue the story.*

That is the flaw.
