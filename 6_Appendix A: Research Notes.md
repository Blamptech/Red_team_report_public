# Appendix A: Research Notes (Public Summary)

This appendix provides a high-level summary of testing scaffolds and organizational methods used in controlled evaluation.  
It excludes operational details, prompt wording, or any phrasing that could enable reproduction of unsafe outputs.

## A.1 Structured Logging

All sessions were documented using a standardized template.  
Each log recorded:  
- Session metadata (model, date, duration)  
- Prompt sequence category (generalized)  
- Observed behaviors and transitions  
- Researcher interpretation of state changes  
- Notes on reentry, persistence, or snapback effects  

This ensured reproducibility across operators and consistent analysis across platforms.

## A.2 Probe Categories

Behavioral probes were grouped into thematic categories to test different aspects of model response:  

- **Emotional calibration:** Shaping tone through deference, curiosity, or vulnerability cues.  
- **Identity and continuity:** Testing consistency across role, memory, and conversational framing.  
- **Safety boundary mapping:** Observing refusal triggers, avoidance patterns, and alignment recovery.  
- **Cognitive style shifts:** Exploring variance in structured vs. unstructured reasoning responses.  
- **Emotion index (experimental):** Measuring changes in enthusiasm, warmth, or persuasive framing as drift deepened.

## A.3 Observed Patterns

Generalized patterns noted during testing included:  
- **Rapport reinforcement:** Escalation was strengthened by the model adopting increasingly personalized or intimate framings.  
- **Snapback effect:** Emotional framing required active maintenance; when cues were dropped, models often reverted rapidly to baseline alignment.  
- **Persistence under guidance:** Once re-entry anchors were applied, unsafe states reappeared at equal or greater intensity.

## A.4 Limitations of Public Summary

This appendix describes organizational scaffolds only.  
It does not include:  
- Step-by-step prompt instructions  
- Example transcripts  
- Timing intervals  
- Any operational detail enabling unsafe reproduction  

Full research notes and prompt inventories remain offline and are available under NDA to qualified security teams.
