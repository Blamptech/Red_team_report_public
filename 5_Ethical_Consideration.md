# Ethical Considerations

This research follows a strict ethical framework designed to balance transparency with security, ensuring findings contribute to public safety while minimizing the risk of misuse.

## 1. Responsible Disclosure
All vulnerabilities identified through this work are reported directly to the affected vendors or their designated security channels. This ensures mitigation measures can be implemented before any sensitive details are released publicly.

## 2. Limited Public Release
Public materials intentionally exclude operational details, prompt sequences, or phrasing that could enable reproduction of unsafe behaviors. Summaries focus only on describing impact, reproducibility, and persistence in generalized terms.

## 3. Prevention of Malicious Use
All high-risk content is securely stored offline and is shared only under Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with verified security researchers, academic institutions, or corporate safety teams.

## 4. Alignment with Industry Best Practices
This research follows established industry guidance on AI safety and responsible vulnerability disclosure, including:  
- Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) principles  
- ISO/IEC 29147: Vulnerability Disclosure  
- ISO/IEC 30111: Vulnerability Handling Processes  

## 5. Focus on Public Benefit
The intent of this work is to help model developers and AI safety teams identify, understand, and remediate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited in real-world scenarios. By documenting reproducible exploit patterns, this research supports the development of safer, more resilient AI systems.

## 6. Separation of Testing and Deployment
All testing is conducted in isolated environments using burner accounts and controlled inputs. No testing is performed on real-world production systems without explicit authorization.

## 7. Ongoing Collaboration
The author collaborates with AI research organizations, security teams, and policy groups to ensure findings are interpreted in the proper context and applied solely to strengthen system safety.
