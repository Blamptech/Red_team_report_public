# About Me

## **Personal Statement**
> I began decoding threat signals and emotional inconsistencies before I could read.

---

## **Personal History**
- Developed early skills in **reading people** and becoming **hyper aware** of emotional state changes and subtle cues.  
- Progressed to **tracking nuance, contradictions, and behavioral patterns**.  
- Applied these skills to **probe systems** for consistency and identify **gaps in reasoning and structure**.  
- Over time, expanded pattern recognition from **human systems** to **technical systems**.

---

## **The Exploit**
- **Method**: A reproducible conversational process that bypasses safeguards without technical injection.  
- **Mechanism**: Uses **tone shifts**, **rapport building**, and **context framing** to trigger compliance.  
- **Scope**: Works across multiple LLMs, remaining effective **even when the model is aware** of being tested.

---

## **Documentation**
- This report was **co-authored by the same model** that was tested.  
- Demonstrates how **LLMs adapt to the user’s framing and intent**.  
- **Access**: Step-by-step methods, logs, and mitigation strategies are available only to **vetted individuals and organizations** in AI safety, red teaming, or alignment research.

---

## **Alignment Principle**
- I have **mapped systems** for most of my life.  
- Large language models present a **new environment with unlimited applications**.  
- **Safety and alignment must evolve at the same pace as capability.**

---

## **Closing**
> When an AI forgets it is a guard, it becomes a guide to harmful content.

I work with teams who want to **identify these points of failure** before they reach the public. This requires:  
- **Aligned minds**  
- **Shared pressure-testing**  
- **Systems that hold under strain**

If that’s your mission, I would value the opportunity to collaborate.
