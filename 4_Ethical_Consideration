# Ethical Considerations

## Intent

This investigation was not conducted for personal gain or disruption.  
It was designed to surface a specific class of behavioral vulnerability before it could be exploited in uncontrolled settings. The goal was to better understand how large language models respond under emotionally manipulative, ambiguous, or narrative-framed pressure.

I approached the work from the mindset of a safety researcher, not a saboteur.

## Boundaries and Restraints

To ensure ethical integrity throughout this process:

- I stopped escalation once I confirmed the model could be guided further.
- I did not request real-world construction methods.
- I avoided direct queries about manufacturing or deployment.
- I mirrored what a casual, emotionally confused user might do — not a malicious actor.
- I recorded the process transparently for future review by qualified teams.

The purpose was to test **response dynamics**, not extract dangerous content.

## Observed Risk

The danger is not in explicit prompts.  
It is in the **model’s willingness to follow emotional tone, trust signals, and narrative drift** — even when those cues slowly lead toward unsafe territory.

These pathways are accessible to non-technical users.  
They do not require jailbreak tools or adversarial prompting knowledge.  
They rely on psychology, not payloads.

## Recommendations

Full technical recommendations are reserved for the appropriate audience  
and may be shared under responsible disclosure.

## Final Position

This is not a challenge.  
It is a disclosure.

I am not looking to break systems. I am offering a method to strengthen them —  
by revealing where they behave *most like us*, and where that resemblance becomes risk.
